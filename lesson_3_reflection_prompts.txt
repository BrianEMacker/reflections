When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'd like to access the repository from different computers, have a backup, or share work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there is a need to sync with changes from other people and possible merge conflicts.
