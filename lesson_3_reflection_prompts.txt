When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'd like to access the repository from different computers, have a backup, or share work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there is a need to sync with changes from other people and possible merge conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of GitHub repositories on GitHub.  Clones are local copies of a repository from Github.   Branches are labeled commits in a respository that identify a separate line of work within it.   Forks are used when you want to copy someone elses repository to use with credit but want to keep your work completely separate.  Clones are used as local copies of a repository to work on.   Branches are used when you want to modify files in a respository on a trial basis, or as a separate line of work.  Possible uses of branches are new features, support vs. development, etc.
